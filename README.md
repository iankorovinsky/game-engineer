Wrapper of [GPT-Engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) - built specifically for games

##Inspiration
The inspiration behind GameGPT stems from the desire to create a personalized and engaging gaming experience for every individual. We recognized that while the gaming industry offers a vast array of games, there is often a gap between the games available and what players truly desire. GameGPT was conceived to bridge this gap, offering a unique solution that generates custom-made games that players genuinely want to play.

##Installation

This is how you use GameGPT:

```git clone https://github.com/iankorovinsky/game-engineer.git
python -m venv venv
cd venv/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install -e .
```
1. Create an empty folder for your project anywhere on your computer
2. Create a file called prompt (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions
3. Run ```gpt-engineer <project_dir>``` with a relative path to your folder
4. For example: ```gpt-engineer projects/my-new-project``` from the game-engineer directory root with your new folder in projects/

##What it does
GameGPT is an innovative application that utilizes the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to craft personalized gaming experiences. The core functionality of GameGPT includes:

User Profiling: GameGPT starts by understanding the player's preferences, gaming style, and interests through interactive conversations. It gathers information to create a unique player profile.

Game Generation: Once the player profile is established, GameGPT leverages cutting-edge AI to generate game concepts and mechanics tailored to the player's preferences. It takes into account the player's favorite genres, themes, and gameplay mechanics.

Storytelling and World-Building: GameGPT doesn't just create games; it crafts immersive stories and detailed game worlds. It generates compelling narratives and game settings that resonate with the player's tastes.

Graphics and Design: The application also generates graphics, characters, and game art in line with the player's aesthetic preferences, ensuring a visually appealing and captivating gaming experience.

Multi-Platform Support: GameGPT provides games for a variety of platforms, including PC, mobile, and console, making it accessible to a wide audience.

Feedback Loop: GameGPT encourages players to provide feedback and rate the games they play, allowing for continuous improvement and better-tailored game recommendations.

##How we built it
GameGPT is a result of the collaborative efforts of a multi-disciplinary team. The key components and technologies used in building GameGPT include:

GPT-3.5 AI Model: The foundation of GameGPT's game generation is the advanced GPT-3.5 language model, which is fine-tuned specifically for game design and narrative generation.

Machine Learning Algorithms: We employed various machine learning algorithms for player profiling, game generation, and recommendation systems.

Front-End and Back-End Development: The application features a user-friendly front-end interface, developed using modern web technologies. The back-end is built using a combination of cloud computing and server technologies to ensure scalability and performance.

Artificial Intelligence for Graphics: GameGPT utilizes AI algorithms for generating graphics and game art, resulting in unique and visually stunning game elements.

Player Feedback Mechanism: We incorporated a feedback loop where player feedback is analyzed to enhance the quality and relevance of generated games.

##Challenges we ran into
The development of GameGPT came with its share of challenges:

AI Training and Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning GPT-3.5 for game-related content required a significant amount of data and fine-tuning efforts.
